# In2go

This is a simple system for recording and figure the sales. back-system using golang and js maked the front;

The code may with a lot of bugs since it was young. I have no time to do more,so if you have any idea just push it to me.thanks a lot.

Some differences include:

* There are test files in this code
* All structs are fully fleshed out
* Some of the functions are placed as methods for the struct types instead of being a part of the package
